# Log cabin small boutique hotel booking application

#### Application Requerments
- The Log cabin is a small boutique hotel with 8 luxurious wooden cabins
- They need a custom-built application to manage everything about the hotel booking, cabins, and guests
- This is the internal application used inside the hotel to check in guests as they arrive
- They have nothing right now so they also need the API
- Later they will probably want a customer facing website as well where customers will be able to book stays using the same API
